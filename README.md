# Change-ComputerName-With-Prompt
This simple script will prompt the end user to enter the name they wish to use for their computer and set it accordingly.

It utilizes OSA script to create a dialogue box to prompt the user and save their input as a variable and then sets the host name, the local host name, and computer name to that variable and finishes up with a Jamf Recon to report it back to Jamf Pro inventory.
